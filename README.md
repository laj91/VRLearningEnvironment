# VR Learning Environment (Unity Project)

This is a personal VR learning project developed in Unity as part of my exploration into virtual reality development during my project employment. The main goal was to experiment with VR interaction, scene building, and asset integration.

> This project was built specifically for standalone **Meta Quest** headsets and targets the **Android** platform using Unity's XR Toolkit.

## Features

- Custom 3D environment modeled in Blender  
- VR interaction  
- Unity XR Toolkit integration  
- Several interactable elements and test features

## Purpose

This project is not a finished product, but rather a learning playground where I tested various VR techniques. It served as a valuable stepping stone for my understanding of VR development workflows.

## Assets and Licensing

- Most 3D models are either self-created or sourced from the Unity Asset Store.  
- **Textures are excluded from this repository** due to licensing uncertainty.  
- Some scripts and logic were inspired by publicly available YouTube tutorials.

If any issues arise regarding assets or licensing, I will address and remove the necessary content.

This project is not intended for commercial use or distribution.
